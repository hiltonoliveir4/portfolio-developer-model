        My experience has extended to Backend development, creating APIs and
        routes for academic and financial systems, working with PHP, SQLServer,
        MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases. On the Frontend, I have replicated
        layouts and consumed APIs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also
        played an essential role in modernizing legacy systems, improving user
        interfaces, and refactoring code for a more updated technology stack. My
        focus has been on creating maintainable, robust code with current
        technologies, balancing ongoing maintenance and innovation to enhance
        efficiency and the user experience.

      My experience has focused on Frontend development, where I created
      screens and forms for the Maranh√£o School of Government website. I used
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate layouts and ensure an intuitive
      and user-friendly interface. Additionally, I played a key role in
      modernizing the website, enhancing the user experience, and keeping the

      efficiency, and an improved user experience.
